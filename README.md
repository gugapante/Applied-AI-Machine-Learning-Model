# Applied-AI-Machine-Learning-Model
This is part of my university module for applied AI where I had to create a regression machine learning model to predict the housing prices given a number of specific parameters from the boston housing dataset.

# Findings
The results can be seen in the full report attached. I used four different models including Random Forests, Linear Regression, MLP Regressor and Gradient Boost. The results and accuracy of these models are demonstarted in the report.
